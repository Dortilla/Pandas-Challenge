# School District Analysis Challenge:
## Goal:
### In this assignment, I have been asked with analyzing district-wide standardized test results. My task was to aggregate the data to showcase trends in school performance.

## PyCitySchools:
### The PyCitySchools script opens the files: 'schools_complete.csv' & 'students_complete.csv' and creates multiple DataFrames containing:
    - A District Summary
    - A School Summary
    - Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
    - Lowest Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
    - Math Scores by Grade
    - Scores by Spending
    - Scores by Size
    - Scores by School Type
### The Jupyter Notebook also contains a written report at the **bottom** of the file containing a few conclusions that I gathered from the data.
